      <header><h2>Getting Started</h2></header>
      <h3> Motivation </h3>
      <p> First things first, you need a goal. Some end goal in which you can strive towards and look forward to. Something that will let you realize that all your hard work moving forward will be worth it. When I first started, my goal was due to competition. I wanted to be stronger then the other guy, and so I started lifting. Now I want to be leaner. You also have to realize that goals will change, and once you reach a goal, then just go for the next goal. Simple as that. </p>
      
      <h3> Energy </h3>
      <p> I'm gonna be honest, in the beginning energy won't be a problem. In fact, just showing up to the gym, breathing, and walking out after 10 minutes will give you gains if you're a novice lifter. The individuals who have the biggest problems with lifting are going to be the more advanced lifters who need to do more to elicit enough adaptations in their body to see that small amount of growth. I for one, do not consider myself an advanced enough lifter to have encountered this problem so I also don't consider my words that credible. However, I can speculate that this boils down to diet and eating. Food is energy, if you don't have enough energy, then you aren't eating enough in certain parts of the day. Either that or your not getting enough sleep. 
        <br></br>
  Now if you are feeling that you have less energy as a novice or intermediate lifter, the simple solution to your problem is that you are simply BEING A FKING BITCH! It's that simple. And get this, the more you lift, the more energy you will have to lift more in the future. So that means, the sole reason you are getting tired now, is that you were being a pussy and not lifting enough in the past. </p>
  
  <h3> Time </h3>
  <p> Time is one of the most popular excuses in society today. At least, it is in the University setting. What do I say about it? BULL FKING SHIT THATS WHAT I SAY! No time? Make time. What? You only have an hour? INCREASE THE FKING INTENSITY THEN! I for one can only do a super sprint for around 15 seconds, and that's if I'm trying my hardest. You can even make 10 minute lifting sessions spread throughout the day. I don't care. But time is not the problem, you are the problem. You have 4 jobs, taking 6 courses at University, feeding a family, and pregnant? EXCUSES! </p>
  
  <h3> Just do it </h3>
      <p> The final thing that I've noticed other people have trouble with is lacking the simple notion of just going to the gym or working out. They are so wrapped up in technical details, that they forget that you have to first be in the gym to start! I have a friend who has learned and bought tons of technical knowledge of working out, dieting, what to do and what not to do. However the number of times he hit the gym was negligible. In fact, all this knowledge is wasted, because it isn't applied (cough Jay cough). </p>

    <section id="Consistency/Discipline" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Consistency/Discipline</h1></header>
      <h3> Consistency </h3>
      <p> Just keep on going. Make a set time for yourself where you just gotta go and lift some fking weights. Mine is at 8am. And just do it, over and over again. Do it so much that it feels fking uncomfortable for you to roll out of bed and not do anything in the period of time. You have to get addicted. Addicted to the feeling of breaking down your muscles consistently every single day. You need to become a pyschopath who does shit like that. </p>
      <h3> Discipline </h3>
      <p> Lifting is not a get big quick formula, or a 2 month transformation to superman, and you have to realize that. I know this might be hard to accept but that's just the truth. I for one believe lifting is a test of an individuals discipline in life. How long an individual can stick to one thing for a very long period of time. And when I say long, I mean years and years of work and progress. Obviously there will be cheat days, and rest days, or even break weeks or months. But the ability to continue to get back on the grind without fail is what I believe is the true test of lifting discipline. I for one have the same problem, there are times when I just don't lift. And it sucks for me, but I've promised myself, I will stay active and continue to lift for the rest of my life without question. Even if I lack, I will also come back. And that's the mindset you should have getting into lifting.

    <section id="Distractions" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Distractions</h1></header>
      <p> There are 5 topics of distractions I would like to touch on.
        <ol>
          <li><code> Monotony</code></li>
          <li><code>Eating</code></li>
          <li><code> Girls</code> </li>
          <li><code> Dysmorphia</code> </li>
          <li><code> Breaks </code></li>
      </ol>
      <h3> Monotony </h3>
      <p> Sometimes lifting can get boring. True. On god, no cap. Doing the same thing over and over again, are you a fking robot? The answer to this question is yes...and no. I will say, to become a more advanced lifter, you will have to rewire your brain to think differently then others. 
        <ol>
          <li><code> You have to feel joy in pain </code></li>
          <li><code> The only present enjoyment you will get is the ability to lift the same thing that you done many times harder, and heavier</code> </li>
          <li> <code>You will get emotional over lifts (definitely not normal) </code></li>
          <li> <code>Sometimes you will check out guys more then girls, it's just how it works. No homo btw </code></li>
      </ol>
      Some things I do to get around this is to have external motivation. Work out with a friend, or a coach, or even your dog. Have something or someone there that will make your workouts more enjoyable and less monotonous. Unless you are a robot, then good on you. I for one have realized that there is a limit to how much your internal motivation can...well, motivate you. I find at least a 10% increase in strength when having external motivation. </p>
  <h3> Eating </h3>
  <p> A lot of people say that eating is the key to getting fit. I agree with that loosely, and to a point. Why? Because it mostly refers to the more intermediate or advanced lifters (or the old boomers). If you are a novice, you can eat whatever the fk you want! As long as you hit the gym, your golden my dude. You will see gains right away without needing to worry about that shit, so don't worry about it for now. I honestly feel like people think too much about what they eat and not enough lifting. My simple rule of thumb is that if you want to gain weight, just eat more, and if you want to lose weight, eat less. As long as your hitting the gym or staying active, then don't worry about shit. 
  <h3> Girls </h3>
  <p> All I gotta say, is that some girls come into the gym with god dam fking lordosis. You have no chance. One way or another you will catch a glimpse, and you will fall into the abyss. Your mindset will fail and the time between sets will only get longer. My advice? JUST STOP BEING A BITCH. STOP STARING! GET A LOOK AND THEN BOOM, KEEP GOING WITH YOUR WORKOUT!
  <h3> Dysmorphia </h3>
  <p> One way or another, as a lifter, and even as a regular person, you will fall into the hole known as body dysmporphia. It sucks, but nothing you can really do about. You got social media portraying the perfect body all the time. And theres a better chance that those social media perfect bodies have more body dysmorphia then even you! You just gotta live with it and keep going. But theres a catch, and that's one of the reasons I love working out so much. Lifting will allow you to change, to shape your body to what you desire, naturally. Too fat? Train for it. Too skinny? Train for it! Have a small dick? TRAIN FOR IT! Lifting will solve all your problems...I read it in the broly bible. 
  <h3> Breaks </h3>
  <p> Life will always throw curveballs your way and breaks are bound to happen. Be it a week, a month, or even a few years. It might happen to any of us. Going on a vacation, being "too busy" to workout, planning a wedding, planning a funeral, injuries. So many things have the ability to stop you from lifting. But as long as you are able to get back on the grind, then that's all that matters. </p>

    <section id="Further_Learning" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Further Learning</h1></header>
    <p> Honestly, to work out you can do two things. 
      <ol>
        <li><code>Go to the gym, figure it out yourself, and just see how things work</code></li>
        <li><code>Get someone to teach you how to lift</code></li>
      </ol>
      Yea, the second option is many times easier and probably more efficient the the first so that's what I'm going to recommend. And keep it mind, getting someone to teach you doesn't necesarilly mean that you need to hire a coach or personal trainer to work you through workouts. You can watch youtube videos, read blogs, look at articles, and many other things to test out how to workout. And keep in mind, there is no one right way to lift. I would say as general and similar lifting is to everyone. Everyone will lift differently, you just have to figure out which way suits you best. And honestly, lifting is still not fully explored, I would say that there is many more things left to uncover and we haven't even scratched the surface of learning how to lift. At the end of the day, learn more, and do whatever the fk feels right for you.

    <section id="Life_Integration" class="main-section">
      <header><h1>Life Integration</h1></header>
      <p> Finally, the further you go along this journey, the more you will be able to identify with lifting. You might even use lifting as an identiy or a conversation starter. It will be a part of your life that you just can't replace. For example for me, I usually don't get emotional watching youtube videos, however when I watched a particular video where a grown ass muscular man started to cry after hitting a 700lb deadlift for the first time. Man, that shit gets kinda relatable. I feel like as I progressed as a lifter, I became more passionate, but also more humble. I can realize the hard work other individuals have put into their body because I can relate on the same level. And I am sure other lifters feel the same way. On the other hand, I don't bash on other peoples physiques because I know how hard it is! Those wack people who make fun of other people, I can guarantee that they just haven't lifted enough!
